### Project Overview
This project aims to give the viewer a tool to analyze the changes in political regimes over time, the spatial distriubtion of those political types, as well as the impact of US/UN democratically backed interventions on those changes. This is not the final step in determining the relationship between space, poltics, and intervnetions, but rather a first step, intended to challenge your thinking and excite curiosity as well as answer questions about the distribution of democracy and interventions.
